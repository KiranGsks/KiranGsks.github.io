        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What This Means:</strong>
        </p>

            <li>The transaction is processed entirely by Google Play</li>
            <li>We only receive confirmation that the purchase was successful</li>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The app requires the following permissions to function:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensors (Wear OS):</strong> To detect device tilt for game controls</li>

            <li><strong>Wearable Communication:</strong> To sync game credits between watch and phone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are used exclusively for the stated purposes and do not enable us to collect 
            personal information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Retro Tennis integrates with the following third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For in-app purchases and app distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob (Companion App only):</strong> For displaying advertisements</li>
            <li><strong>Play Integrity API:</strong> For security and anti-tampering measures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these services has its own privacy policy governing how they handle data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Privacy Information</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Retro Tennis is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, 
            there is no special data handling for children under 13 (COPPA) or under 16 (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the companion app displays advertisements through Google AdMob. Parents and guardians 
            should be aware that AdMob may collect certain information as described in section 4 above.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If your child is using the app and you have concerns about advertising, we recommend:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchasing the premium version to remove ads entirely</li>
            <li>Adjusting ad personalization settings on your child's device</li>
            <li>Reviewing Google's Family Link and parental control options</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement security measures to protect the integrity of the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device integrity checks using Google Play Integrity API and SafetyNet</li>
            <li>HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for secure communication between devices</li>
            <li>Local data obfuscation and integrity checks to prevent tampering</li>
            <li>No transmission of personal data over networks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect or store personal data on external servers, there is minimal risk of 
            data breaches involving your personal information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect personal data, most data protection rights (such as data access, 
            correction, or deletion requests) are not applicable. However:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete all locally stored game data by 
            clearing the app's data in your device settings or uninstalling the app</li>
            <li><strong>Ad Personalization:</strong> You can control ad personalization through your 
            device's advertising settings</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> Contact Google Play support for any questions 
            about purchase records</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. International Users</h2>
        <p>
            Retro Tennis is available globally through Google Play Store. Since we do not collect or 
            transfer personal data, international data transfer regulations (such as GDPR or CCPA) 
            have minimal applicability.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, third-party services (Google Play, AdMob) may transfer data internationally as 
            described in their respective privacy policies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
